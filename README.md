# Agentic AI

Agentic AI is a robust multi-agent system built with **phidata**, designed to seamlessly handle web search queries and financial analysis tasks. This project leverages advanced AI models and specialized tools for efficient data retrieval, presentation, and actionable insights.

## Features

### Web Search Agent
- Conducts web searches using DuckDuckGo for reliable and private results.
- Provides well-referenced outputs with accurate source citations.

### Finance Agent
- Offers comprehensive financial insights using YFinanceTools:
  - Stock prices
  - Analyst recommendations
  - Company news
  - Technical indicators
- Outputs data in easy-to-read tables.

### Multi-Agent System
- Combines Web Search and Finance agents for seamless task execution.
- Ensures consistent, structured responses in markdown format.

## How It Works

Agentic AI uses **phidata** to create specialized agents for different tasks. Each agent is powered by the `Groq` AI model and equipped with domain-specific tools, enabling efficient multi-tasking and detailed outputs. The system can be customized further by adding new tools or modifying instructions for each agent.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more tools for diverse domains like healthcare and education.
- Real-time deployment for production-grade applications.
- Integration with additional AI models and APIs.
